This official book is part of the official documentation. It is currently
partly outdated.

.. tip::

   For TYPO3 9, you may want to check out the 3rd edition of
   the book `Michael Schams: "TYPO3 Extbase: Modern Extension
   Development for TYPO3 CMS with Extbase & Fluid"
   <https://www.extbase-book.org/>`__. This is *not official
   TYPO3 documentation*, but it was just released for TYPO3 9
   and should be up to date.
