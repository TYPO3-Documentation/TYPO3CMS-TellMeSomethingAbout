Official Documentation
======================

• :ref:`t3extbasebook:start`

This official book is part of the official documentation. It is currently
partly outdated.

.. tip::

   For TYPO3 9, you may want to check out the 3rd edition of the book `Michael
   Schams: "TYPO3 Extbase: Modern Extension Development for TYPO3 CMS with
   Extbase & Fluid" <https://www.extbase-book.org/>`__. This is *not official
   TYPO3 documentation*, but it was just released for TYPO3 9 and should be up
   to date.
