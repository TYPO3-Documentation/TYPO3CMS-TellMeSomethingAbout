Tell Me Something About ...
===========================

What does it do?
================

"Tell me something about" is the name for that part of the documentation that
doesn't exactly fit into common rubrics like reference, guide, tutorial or
how-to. **1.** The goal is to name and list topics that people often need help
with. **2.** Hopefully the list then inspires knowledgable members of the community
to provide some explanations. **3.** And finally the intention is to have a place
to provide links to other community writings like blogpostings.
