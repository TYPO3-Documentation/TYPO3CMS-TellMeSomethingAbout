Developing some ReST style guides for this manual
=================================================

* Define common, frequently needed link definitions in :file:`Includes.txt`.

* Use the star `*` in general to mark up unordered list. It is better readable
  in online editing.
  
* Use 50 underscores `_` to mark up a transistion. The minimum would be 4.

* In general: Use upper in headlines only for the document title ('doctitle').

* The first headline (= section) of a file is its document title.
